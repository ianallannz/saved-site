## Risks

There are always reasons not to do something. And there are several risks that could end this venture.

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation/Action | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Low demand for non-Windows laptops | Medium-High | Critical | Demonstrate the Saved experience as better than before; either wind down as a private venture if cannot overcome risk or prioritise franchise opportunity in larger and/or more receptive regions. |
| Low demand for Saved laptops priced in the $100 range | Medium-High | Critical | Demonstrate the $100 in value; either wind down as a private venture if cannot overcome risk or prioritise franchise opportunity in larger and/or more receptive regions. |
| Low demand for enterprise support and maintenance agreements | Medium-High | Medium-High | Continue to advocate for other ways of working; shelve enterprise support and maintenance as a revenue line. |
| Cannot maintain enough free cashflow to fund required operations | High | Critical | Seek philanthropic angel investor to support early growth stages, or wind down as a private venture if cannot overcome risk. |
| Founder fails to establish a cornerstone partner (such as WINZ) promptly enough | Medium | Medium | Maintain high engagement with potential partners; bring forward retail presence. |
| Saved is regarded as a self-centred for-profit competitor in the ecosystem | High | Medium | Be publicly transparent about the make-up of the cost+ pricing to show it is a fair and reasonable model, and the most viable way to save the scale of laptops. |
| Founder fails to develop working relationships in the ecosystem | Medium | Medium | Be better at getting-to-know the people in the ecosystem; be useful. |
| New Zealand’s largest e-waste recycling company Echo or the Recycle A Device initiative scales up to suitably address the Windows 10 problem nationwide | Medium | High | Demonstrate the differentiated value of Saved; wind down as a private venture if cannot overcome incumbent momentum. |
| Cannot acquire a suitable storage and processing centre promptly enough | Medium-Low | Medium-Low | Seek on-site processing; use the founder's home. |
| High accumulation of unusable computers and peripherals | Medium | Medium-Low | Send to e-waste facilities after 3-6 months if/when no interest shown by the public; send to e-waste sooner if suitable storage and processing centre not acquired. |
| Cannot make laptop upgrade process efficient enough at scale | Medium-Low | Medium-High | Rely on ongoing technical expertise to achieve operational efficiencies. |
| Lack of technical expertise to save laptops | Low | High | Acquire additional expertise if cashflow available; use AI support when founder expertise hits limits. |
| Founder does not have enough available capacity to successfully drive the venture | Medium | High | Seek philanthropic angel investor to free-up more time; look at ways to slow the rate of progress while still saving the laptops; hand over operations to an entity with capacity. |
| Low demand for diversified retail products | Medium-Low | Medium | Continue product development to better meet demand; use other channels (online, more receptive regions); abandon product(s). |
| Low demand for certifications and qualifications focused on sovereign and resilient technologies | Medium-Low | Medium-Low | Market their usefulness vs alternatives. |
