## Solution: Phase 1

Saved will collect, process, upgrade, reimagine, and redistribute laptops, with warranties.

### Collect and process

Computers are securely collected from organisations and taken to a storage and processing centre:

- A sale and purchase agreement is used to contractually change ownership
- Laptops are prioritised, however desktop computers and peripherals will also be collected (consideration will be given to desktop computer use cases, for example, as home media centre PCs)
- Computers are securely formatted to untraceably remove all sensitive information (this documented and transparent process can be completed on-premise for added trust)
- Laptops will be physically cleaned, sanitised, and checked for structural weaknesses
- A knowledge base is used to classify laptops into states of readiness for upgrade and subsequent barcoding
- Unsaveable computers and peripherals will be sorted and held for 3-6 months and made available to the public 
- Later, the service will extend to personal computers.

### Upgrade and reimagine

#### A viable alternative operating system

There is now a viable alternative operating system that gives these saved Windows 10 laptops a secure, stable, fast, enjoyable second life for many more years.

**The upgrade is [Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/ "Zorin OS website")**, a distribution of Linux.

Open source Linux alternatives have been tried in the past, however they have not stood up to the user expectations and familiarity of Windows. 

**This time it’s different:**

- Zorin has a slicker, richer user interface than Windows
- Zorin can be switched to feel like Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS, or a sharper blend of them all
- Zorin runs smoother than Windows on equivalent hardware—it makes a 7 year old laptop feel new again
- Most of our daily computing tasks now happen in our web browsers—from communication to office productivity to design—so the claim that “Linux doesn’t have the software I need” no longer holds for most people.

*Note: The intention is not to mimic Windows 10 or even Windows 11 as accurately as possible. Doing so would still feel like playing basketball with a netball—just not quite right.*

#### Upgrade at scale

A networked, operationalised process will be implemented to upgrade ready laptops at scale. 

#### Better than before

Several default configurations will be established for the laptops to offer different flavours for different tastes. These will include defaults for: user interface, themes, apps, security, use cases, and getting started tutorials. 

The laptops will be physically skinned to represent their renewed state.

**Overall, a Saved laptop will be better than before.** From the bubbly and bright browser, to the techy and dark developer. 

**It will be cool to have a Saved laptop.**

### Redistribute

#### Channels and partners

The Saved laptops will be redistributed to the population through channels and partners such as: Work & Income, Private Training Establishments (PTEs), and other education and social services.

#### For a price

The laptops are purchased for a fair price with a warranty, depending on the age and state of the Saved laptop. 

### Support

#### Warranty support

A reasonable warranty is issued with each Saved laptop and supported at a drop-in centre.

An extended warranty could be made available if demand exists. 

#### Workshops

Workshops will be run to:

- Help people get the most out of their Saved laptops 
- Experience a more socially sustainable, resilient, and affordable way of living with technology.
