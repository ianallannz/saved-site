## Operating model

### Phase 1

1. **Collect computers** from organisations through a sale and purchase agreement
2. **Process and upgrade** computers for redistribution
   1. Prioritise laptops
   2. Unsaveable computers and peripherals are sorted and presented to the public for 3-6 months in an appropriate space in
3. **Sell Saved laptops** back into the population, initially through channels, for a fair price in the $100 range with a warranty.

### Phase 2

Using IP developed in Phase 1 to:

- Enter into **support and maintenance agreements** with organisations seeking new ways of working through integration of new and Saved products
- License **franchise opportunities** nationwide.

### Phase 3

Build on brand connection to:

- **Establish a hybrid retail presence**
- **Deliver certifications and qualifications** in sovereign and resilient technologies.

**NOTE:** Phase 2 and Phase 3 could swap depending on the response to Phase 1 and the position of the venture.

### Private company or social enterprise

It is yet to be determined whether this venture should be positioned as a simple private company or a social enterprise. The current preference is for it to be **a mission-driven private company** to:

- Incentivise long term viability (Windows 10 laptops won’t always need saving)
- Expedite process optimisation
- Drive product and service innovation
- Create commercial IP
- Be in a position to provide warranties, support, and enterprise services
- Attract private capital.
