## Solution: Phase 2 and Phase 3

The specific detail, timing, and order of Phase 2 and Phase 3 is dependent on the momentum and the nature of the IP developed in Phase 1.

### Phase 2: Expansion

It is expected that Phase 1 will generate valuable know-how and IP that can be realised commercially through **enterprise services** and **nationwide franchising**.

#### Enterprise services

Saved enters into support and maintenance agreements with organisations that are seeking new ways of working. 

Through the integration and support of new and Saved products, Saved helps organisations:

- Confidently deploy and manage ethical software alternatives
- Increase the repairability, modularity, and useful life of their laptop fleet
- Reclaim a sense of sovereignty
- Reduce their excruciating monthly software subscriptions.

#### Franchise opportunity

Phase 1 will generate the documentation and technological automation processes to enable the “lift and shift” of operations to other regions. 

The know-how and IP would be licensed to franchisees nationwide.

### Phase 3: Consumer connection

It is anticipated that Phase 1 will generate significant brand visibility and ongoing connections, particularly with young adults as the likely widespread recipients of Saved laptops. 

A deep connection to the brand’s values creates the opportunity for a **hybrid retail presence** and the provision of **certifications and qualifications**.

#### Hybrid retail presence

**The brand is positioned to diversify** into a mix of first-party, related-party, and third-party sourced retail products for:

- Young (15-30, and the young-at-heart) indie creators, artists, developers, environmentalists—the new cyberpunks
- People conscious of their footprint, the cost of living, bigtech lock-in, and addictive design philosophies.

The founder has previously designed related products that are considered to be a natural fit under a Saved retail umbrella. 

The retail presence is imagined to have a strikingly visual “open kitchen” approach to its Saved laptop process automation, and also serve as a drop-in centre, workshop, and learning space.

#### Certifications and qualifications

Saved develops and provides **certifications and qualifications** in sovereign and resilient technologies; these would be:

- Accredited through partnering open source foundations and vocational tertiary providers
- Delivered with a hybrid model, a mix of online and face-to-face learning
- Hubbed from the retail presence with a dedicated learning space.
