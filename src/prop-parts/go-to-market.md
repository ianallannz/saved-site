Indicative vessel logo:

The brand represents:

- The urgent need to save these Windows 10 laptops with a nod to a daily IT action (“have you saved it?”)
- The longer-term need to save us from bigtech lock-in, the high cost of technology, addictive design, and post-automation precarity.

### Market focus

The venture is local-first, only looking to save these Windows 10 laptops before they leave our region. 

Once operationally established, the wider opportunity will be considered; albeit conscious of the urgency of the problem nationwide, and globally. 

### Visibility

Initially the venture is focused on channels and partners and not direct-to-consumer transactions. Even so, the venture will be present in the community and not just positioned as a back-office service.

### Brand voice

Over time, as the venture moves closer to the customer, brand messaging and treatments will position the brand, products, and services to speak to:

- Young (15-30, and the young-at-heart) indie creators, artists, developers, environmentalists—the new cyberpunks
- Those with an urge to live better: conscious of their footprint, the cost of living, bigtech lock-in, and addictive design philosophies. 

#### Example logo treatments

The logo is designed to be used as a vessel for speaking to different audiences.

#### Brand examples in context

Even though a store-front and learning space is anticipated later in the roadmap, the intention is to be present in the community.
