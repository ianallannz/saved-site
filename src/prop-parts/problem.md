## Problem

### Immediate problem

**Microsoft ended support for Windows 10 in October 2025.** Normally this is not a major issue; but this time, because of the hardware requirements Microsoft set for Windows 11, perfectly good Windows 10 computers cannot be upgraded.

**Over a thousand computers in local organisations are destined to head out of the region to e-waste facilities** in 2026. Meanwhile personal computers are becoming security risks. 

Globally there are estimated to be 400m computers facing this premature death.

**These computers can be saved.**

Sentiments are converging around:

- The dominance and entrapment of bigtech
- Loss of identity and data sovereignty
- AI disrupting professional labour markets
- Digital inequities exacerbating wider inequalities
- Precarious education and employment prospects for young and old.
