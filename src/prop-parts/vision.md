## Vision
A new venture that believes: **IT** can be saved, and **WE** can be saved.

### Phase 1: Save local Windows 10 laptops
Saved is a Tairāwhiti-focused commercial alternative to “Recycle A Device” schemes.

The primary focus is **rescuing Windows 10 laptops and upgrading them at scale into reimagined Saved laptops** through process automation, open systems, product development, and warranties.

### Phase 2: Enterprise & nationwide expansion
The **Intellectual Property (IP)** developed in Phase 1 is used to make Saved a:

- Provider of **enterprise services for new and Saved products** to organisations seeking new ways of working
- Nationwide **franchise opportunity**.

### Phase 3: Deep consumer connection
Saved is:

- A **resilient diversified brand** in the market for young (15-30, and the young-at-heart) indie creators, artists, developers, environmentalists—the new cyberpunks
- A provider of **certifications and qualifications** in sovereign and resilient technologies
- For people and organisations conscious of their footprint, the cost of living, bigtech lock-in, and addictive design philosophies. 

**NOTE:** The order of Phase 2 and Phase 3 could depend on the momentum and nature of the IP developed in Phase 1.
