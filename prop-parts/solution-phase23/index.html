<p>The specific detail, timing, and order of Phase 2 and Phase 3 is dependent on the momentum and the nature of the IP developed in Phase 1.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-expansion" tabindex="-1">Phase 2: Expansion <a class="direct-link" href="#phase-2-expansion">#</a></h3>
<p>It is expected that Phase 1 will generate valuable know-how and IP that can be realised commercially through <strong>enterprise services</strong> and <strong>nationwide franchising</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="enterprise-services" tabindex="-1">Enterprise services <a class="direct-link" href="#enterprise-services">#</a></h4>
<p>Saved enters into support and maintenance agreements with organisations that are seeking new ways of working.</p>
<p>Through the integration and support of new and Saved products, Saved helps organisations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confidently deploy and manage ethical software alternatives</li>
<li>Increase the repairability, modularity, and useful life of their laptop fleet</li>
<li>Reclaim a sense of sovereignty</li>
<li>Reduce their excruciating monthly software subscriptions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="franchise-opportunity" tabindex="-1">Franchise opportunity <a class="direct-link" href="#franchise-opportunity">#</a></h4>
<p>Phase 1 will generate the documentation and technological automation processes to enable the “lift and shift” of operations to other regions.</p>
<p>The know-how and IP would be licensed to franchisees nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-consumer-connection" tabindex="-1">Phase 3: Consumer connection <a class="direct-link" href="#phase-3-consumer-connection">#</a></h3>
<p>It is anticipated that Phase 1 will generate significant brand visibility and ongoing connections, particularly with young adults as the likely widespread recipients of Saved laptops.</p>
<p>A deep connection to the brand’s values creates the opportunity for a <strong>hybrid retail presence</strong> and the provision of <strong>certifications and qualifications</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="hybrid-retail-presence" tabindex="-1">Hybrid retail presence <a class="direct-link" href="#hybrid-retail-presence">#</a></h4>
<p><strong>The brand is positioned to diversify</strong> into a mix of first-party, related-party, and third-party sourced retail products for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young (15-30, and the young-at-heart) indie creators, artists, developers, environmentalists—the new cyberpunks</li>
<li>People conscious of their footprint, the cost of living, bigtech lock-in, and addictive design philosophies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The founder has previously designed related products that are considered to be a natural fit under a Saved retail umbrella.</p>
<p>The retail presence is imagined to have a strikingly visual “open kitchen” approach to its Saved laptop process automation, and also serve as a drop-in centre, workshop, and learning space.</p>
<h4 id="certifications-and-qualifications" tabindex="-1">Certifications and qualifications <a class="direct-link" href="#certifications-and-qualifications">#</a></h4>
<p>Saved develops and provides <strong>certifications and qualifications</strong> in sovereign and resilient technologies; these would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accredited through partnering open source foundations and vocational tertiary providers</li>
<li>Delivered with a hybrid model, a mix of online and face-to-face learning</li>
<li>Hubbed from the retail presence with a dedicated learning space.</li>
</ul>
