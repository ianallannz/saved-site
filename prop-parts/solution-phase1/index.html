<p>Saved will collect, process, upgrade, reimagine, and redistribute laptops, with warranties.</p>
<h3 id="collect-and-process" tabindex="-1">Collect and process <a class="direct-link" href="#collect-and-process">#</a></h3>
<p>Computers are securely collected from organisations and taken to a storage and processing centre:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sale and purchase agreement is used to contractually change ownership</li>
<li>Laptops are prioritised, however desktop computers and peripherals will also be collected (consideration will be given to desktop computer use cases, for example, as home media centre PCs)</li>
<li>Computers are securely formatted to untraceably remove all sensitive information (this documented and transparent process can be completed on-premise for added trust)</li>
<li>Laptops will be physically cleaned, sanitised, and checked for structural weaknesses</li>
<li>A knowledge base is used to classify laptops into states of readiness for upgrade and subsequent barcoding</li>
<li>Unsaveable computers and peripherals will be sorted and held for 3-6 months and made available to the public</li>
<li>Later, the service will extend to personal computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is now a viable alternative operating system that gives these saved Windows 10 laptops a secure, stable, fast, enjoyable second life for many more years.</p>
<p><strong>The upgrade is <a href="https://zorin.com/os/" title="Zorin OS website">Zorin OS</a></strong>, a distribution of Linux.</p>
<p><img src="../images/prop-zorin1.webp" alt="Zorin as Windows 10, Windows 11, MacOS, tablet, its own beautiful thing"></p>

<p>Open source Linux alternatives have been tried in the past, however they have not stood up to the user expectations and familiarity of Windows.</p>
<p><strong>This time it’s different:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Zorin has a slicker, richer user interface than Windows</li>
<li>Zorin can be switched to feel like Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS, or a sharper blend of them all</li>
<li>Zorin runs smoother than Windows on equivalent hardware—it makes a 7 year old laptop feel new again</li>
<li>Most of our daily computing tasks now happen in our web browsers—from communication to office productivity to design—so the claim that “Linux doesn’t have the software I need” no longer holds for most people.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The intention is not to mimic Windows 10 or even Windows 11 as accurately as possible. Doing so would still feel like playing basketball with a netball—just not quite right.</em></p>
<h4 id="upgrade-at-scale" tabindex="-1">Upgrade at scale <a class="direct-link" href="#upgrade-at-scale">#</a></h4>
<p>A networked, operationalised process will be implemented to upgrade ready laptops at scale.</p>
<h4 id="better-than-before" tabindex="-1">Better than before <a class="direct-link" href="#better-than-before">#</a></h4>
<p>Several default configurations will be established for the laptops to offer different flavours for different tastes. These will include defaults for: user interface, themes, apps, security, use cases, and getting started tutorials.</p>
<p>The laptops will be physically skinned to represent their renewed state.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, a Saved laptop will be better than before.</strong> From the bubbly and bright browser, to the techy and dark developer.</p>
<p><strong>It will be cool to have a Saved laptop.</strong></p>

<h4 id="channels-and-partners" tabindex="-1">Channels and partners <a class="direct-link" href="#channels-and-partners">#</a></h4>
<p>Preferably, the Saved laptops will be redistributed to the population through channels and partners such as: WINZ; The Environment Centre (TEC); TaiTech; and other iwi and charitable organisations.</p>
<h4 id="for-a-price" tabindex="-1">For a price <a class="direct-link" href="#for-a-price">#</a></h4>
<p>The laptops are purchased for a fair price with a warranty, depending on the age and state of the Saved laptop.</p>

<h4 id="warranty-support" tabindex="-1">Warranty support <a class="direct-link" href="#warranty-support">#</a></h4>
<p>A reasonable warranty is issued with each Saved laptop and supported at a drop-in centre.</p>
<p>An extended warranty could be made available if demand exists.</p>
<h4 id="workshops" tabindex="-1">Workshops <a class="direct-link" href="#workshops">#</a></h4>
<p>Workshops will be run to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help people get the most out of their Saved laptops</li>
<li>Experience a more socially sustainable, resilient, and affordable way of living with technology.</li>
</ul>
