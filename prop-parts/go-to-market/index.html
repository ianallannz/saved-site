<p>The brand represents:</p>
<ul>
<li>The urgent need to save these Windows 10 laptops with a nod to a daily IT action (“have you saved it?”)</li>
<li>The longer-term need to save us from bigtech lock-in, the high cost of technology, addictive design, and post-automation precarity.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="market-focus" tabindex="-1">Market focus <a class="direct-link" href="#market-focus">#</a></h3>
<p>The venture is local-first, only looking to save these Windows 10 laptops before they leave our region.</p>
<p>Once operationally established, the wider opportunity will be considered; albeit conscious of the urgency of the problem nationwide, and globally.</p>
<h3 id="visibility" tabindex="-1">Visibility <a class="direct-link" href="#visibility">#</a></h3>
<p>Initially the venture is focused on channels and partners and not direct-to-consumer transactions. Even so, the venture will be present in the community and not just positioned as a back-office service.</p>
<h3 id="brand-voice" tabindex="-1">Brand voice <a class="direct-link" href="#brand-voice">#</a></h3>
<p>Over time, as the venture moves closer to the customer, brand messaging and treatments will position the brand, products, and services to speak to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young (15-30, and the young-at-heart) indie creators, artists, developers, environmentalists—the new cyberpunks</li>
<li>Those with an urge to live better: conscious of their footprint, the cost of living, bigtech lock-in, and addictive design philosophies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The logo is designed to be used as a vessel for speaking to different audiences.</p>

<em>Initial prompt: an image in-store, I want it to have a plywood feel for the display of the laptops etc, a bit like a local izakaya/bar in Japan - a bit of a lived-in feel, definitely not too rustic, and still a cool vibe.</em></figcaption>
